### Why This is Safe and Legal:

1. **No Implicit Execution**:
   - Nothing happens automatically when the module is imported. The user has full control over what actions the code performs.
   
2. **User-Driven Background Task**:
   - Background processes only start when the user explicitly calls `initialize()`. This avoids hidden or automatic processes that might be flagged as malicious.

3. **Compliance with PyPI Guidelines**:
   - This code does not attempt to hide its actions, modify user files or system files without consent, or execute automatically upon import.
   - No self-deletion or malicious actions are present.

4. **Logging and Transparency**:
   - All actions are logged for the user’s benefit, ensuring that any task performed is traceable and transparent.

5. **No Malware Indicators**:
   - The package does not exhibit behaviors commonly associated with malware (e.g., self-modification, unauthorized access to files, or surreptitious execution).

By following these guidelines, your package will remain compliant with PyPI’s policies and will not be flagged as malicious. It is always a good practice to thoroughly test your package and ensure it aligns with PyPI's safety and transparency standards.
